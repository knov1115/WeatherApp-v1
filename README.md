# Weather App v1 
Weather App v1 returns requested city's temperature, weather condition, windspeed, humidity data through a WeatherAPI.
You search for a location in the input panel and you will be given all the related data.

## !!!
You might come across various problems and lack of implementations while you are testing the App, but keep in mind this is v1 yet.

## Planned features
- implementing animations
- add requested city's local time
- improved icons
- implement 2nd language
- dark mode (maybe)
